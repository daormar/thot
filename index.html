<h2>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Thot is an open source software toolkit for statistical machine
translation (SMT). Originally, Thot incorporated tools to train
phrase-based models. The new version of Thot now includes a
state-of-the-art phrase-based translation decoder as well as tools to
estimate all of the models involved in the translation process. In
addition to this, Thot is also able to incrementally update its models
in real time after presenting an individual sentence pair using online
learning.</p>

<p>Thot is being developed by <a href="http://daormar.github.io/">Daniel
Ortiz-Martínez</a>. Daniel is a researcher on natural language
processing
at <a href="http://webinterpret.com/">Webinterpret</a>. Formerly, he was
a member of the <a href="https://www.prhlt.upv.es/">PRHLT research
group</a> as well as an assistant professor at
the <a href="http://www.upv.es/">Technical University of
Valencia</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="news" class="anchor" href="#news" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>News</h2>

<a id="distribution-details" class="anchor" href="#distribution-details" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Distribution Details</h2>

<p>Thot has been coded using C, C++, Python and shell-scripting. Thot is
known to compile on Unix-like and Windows (using Cygwin) systems. See
the "Documentation and Support" section of these instructions if you
experience problems during compilation.</p>

<p>It is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<h4>
<a id="basic-installation-procedure" class="anchor" href="#basic-installation-procedure" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic Installation Procedure</h4>

<p>To install Thot, first you need to install the autotools (autoconf,
autoconf-archive, automake and libtool packages in Ubuntu). If you are
planning to use Thot on a Windows platform, you also need to install
the <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>
environment. Alternatively, Thot can also be installed on Mac OS X
systems using <a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some of the code used for corpus
pre/post-processing (see more on this in the Thot manual) is based on
the <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)</a>
library. Those users interested in using the pre/post-processing
functionality incorporated in Thot will need to install that library as
well.</p>

<p>Once the autotools are available (as well as other required software
such as Cygwin, MacPorts or the NLTK library), you can proceed with the
installation of Thot by following the next sequence of steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Obtain the package using git:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/daormar/thot.git
</code></pre>

<p>Or <a href="https://github.com/daormar/thot/archive/master.zip">download it in a zip file</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>cd</code> to the directory containing the package's source code and type
<code>./reconf</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>./configure</code> to configure the package.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>make</code> to compile the package.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>make install</code> to install the programs and any data files and
documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
code directory by typing <code>make clean</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By default the files are installed under the /usr/local/ directory (or
similar, depending of the OS you use); however, since Step 5 requires
root privileges, another directory can be specified during Step 3 by
typing:</p>

<pre><code> $ configure --prefix=&lt;absolute-installation-path&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For example, if "user1" wants to install the Thot package in the
directory /home/user1/thot, the sequence of commands to execute should be
the following:</p>

<pre><code> $ ./reconf
 $ configure --prefix=/home/user1/thot
 $ make
 $ make install
</code></pre>

<p>The installation directory can be the same directory where the Thot
package was decompressed.</p>

<p>See "INSTALL" file for more information.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: if Thot is being installed in a PBS cluster (a cluster
providing <code>qsub</code> and other related tools), it is important that the
<code>configure</code> script is executed in the main cluster node, so as to
properly detect the cluster configuration (do not execute it in an
interactive session).</p>

<h4>
<a id="alternative-installation-options" class="anchor" href="#alternative-installation-options" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Alternative Installation Options</h4>

<p>The Thot configure script can be used to modify the toolkit
behavior. Here is a list of current installation options:</p>

<ul>
<li> <b><code>--enable-ibm2-alig</code></b>: Thot currently uses
HMM-based alignment models to obtain the word alignment matrices
required for phrase model estimation. One alternative installation
option allows to replace HMM-based alignment models by IBM 2 alignment
models. IBM 2 alignment models can be estimated very efficiently without
significantly affecting translation quality.</li>

<li> <b><code>--with-casmacat</code></b>: this options enables the
configuration required for the CasMaCat Workbench, see more information
below.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="installation-including-the-casmacat-workbench" class="anchor" href="#installation-including-the-casmacat-workbench" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation Including the CasMaCat Workbench</h4>

<p>Thot can be combined with the CasMacat Workbench that is being developed
in the project of the same name. <a href="http://www.casmacat.eu/index.php?n=Workbench.Workbench">See this webpage</a> to get the specific
installation instructions.</p>

<h4 id="checking-package-installation">Checking Package Installation</h4>

<p>Once the package has been installed, it is possible to perform basic
checkings in an automatic manner so as to detect portability errors. For
this purpose, the following command can be used:</p>

<pre><code> $ make installcheck</code></pre>

<p>The tests performed by the previous command involve the execution of
the main tasks present in a typical SMT pipeline, including training and
tuning of model parameters as well as generating translations using the
estimated models (see more on this in the Thot manual). The command
internally uses the toy corpus provided with the Thot package to carry
out the checkings.</p>

<h2>
<a id="relation-with-existing-software" class="anchor" href="#relation-with-existing-software" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Relation with Existing Software</h2>

<p>Due to the strong focus of Thot on online and incremental learning, it
includes its own programs to carry out language and translation model
estimation. Specifically, Thot includes tools to work with n-gram
language models based on incrementally updateable sufficient
statistics. On the other hand, Thot also includes a set of tools and a
whole software library to estimate IBM 1, IBM 2 and HMM-based word
alignment models. The estimation process can be carried out using batch
and incremental EM algorithms. This functionality is not based on the
standard GIZA++ software for word alignment model generation.</p>

<p>Additionally, Thot does not use any code from other existing
translation tools. In this regard, Thot tries to offer its own view of
the process of statistical machine translation, with a strong focus on
online learning and also incorporating interactive machine translation
functionality. Another interesting feature of the toolkit is its stable
and robust translation server.</p>

<h2>
<a id="current-status" class="anchor" href="#current-status" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Status</h2>

<p>The Thot toolkit is under development. Original public versions of Thot
date back to 2005 [Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2005] and were hosted in
SourceForge. These original versions were strongly focused on the
estimation of phrase-based models. By contrast, current version offers
several new features that had not been previously incorporated.</p>

<p>A set of specific tools to ease the process of making SMT experiments
has been created.  Basic usage instructions have been recently added to
the Thot manual.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are some toolkit extensions that will be
incorporated in the next months:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Improved management of concurrency in the Thot translation server
(concurrent translation processes are currently handled with mutual
exclusion).</p></li>
<li><p>Virtualized language models (i.e. accessing language model parameters
from disk).</p></li>
<li><p>Interpolation of language and translation models.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, here is a list of known issues with the Thot toolkit that are
currently being addressed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Phrase model training is based on HMM-based word alignment models
estimated by means of incremental EM. The current implementation is slow
and currently constitutes a bottleneck when training phrase models from
large corpora. One already implemented solution is to carry out the
estimation in multiple processors.  Another solution is to replace
HMM-based models by IBM 2 Models, which can be estimated very
efficiently. However, we are also investigating alternative optimization
techniques to efficiently execute the estimation process of HMM-based
models in a single processor.</p></li>
<li><p>Log-linear model weight adjustment is carried out by means of the
downhill simplex algorithm, which is slow. Downhill simplex will
be replaced by a more efficient technique.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-monotonic translation is not yet sufficiently tested, specially
with complex corpora such as Europarl.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information about the theoretical foundations of Thot can be
found in [Ortiz-Martínez, 2011]. One interesting feature of Thot,
incremental (or online) estimation of statistical models, is also
described in [Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2010]. Finally, phrase-level
alignment generation functionality implemented in Thot was proposed in
[Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2008].</p>
