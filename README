Thot: a Software Toolkit for Statistical Machine Translation
============================================================ 

Introduction
------------
Thot is an open source software toolkit for statistical machine
translation (SMT). Originally, Thot incorporated tools to train
phrase-based models. The new version of Thot now includes a
state-of-the-art phrase-based translation decoder as well as tools to
estimate all of the models involved in the translation process. In
addition to this, Thot is also able to incrementally update its models
in real time after presenting an individual sentence pair using online
learning techniques.

Thot is being developed by [Daniel Ortiz-Martínez] [1]. Daniel is a
member of the [PRHLT research group] [2] at the [Technical University of
Valencia] [3].


News

- Phrase-based statistical machine translation decoder.
- Computer-aided translation (post-editing and interactive machine translation).
- Incremental estimation of all of the models involved in the translation process.
- Robust generation of alignments at phrase-level.
- Client-server implementation of the translation functionality.
- Single word alignment model estimation using the incremental EM algorithm.
- Scalable and parallel model estimation algorithms using Map-Reduce.
- Compiles on Unix-like and Windows (using Cygwin) systems.
- Integration with the [CasMaCat Workbench] [4] developed in the EU FP7 [CasMaCat project] [5].

Distribution Details
--------------------
Thot has been coded using C, C++ and shell-scripting. Thot is known to
compile on Unix-like and Windows (using Cygwin) systems. See the
"Documentation and Support" section of these instructions if you
experience problems during compilation.

It is released under the [GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)] [6].


Installation
------------

#### Basic Installation Procedure
To install Thot, first you need to install the autotools (autoconf,
autoconf-archive, automake and libtool packages in Ubuntu). If you are
planning to use Thot on a Windows platform, you also need to install the
Cygwin environment.

Once the autotools are available (as well as Cygwin if required), you
can proceed with the installation of Thot by following the next sequence
of steps:

 1. Obtain the package using git:

        $ git clone https://github.com/daormar/thot.git

    Or [download it in a zip file] [7]

 2. `cd` to the directory containing the package's source code and type
    `./reconf`.

 3. Type `./configure` to configure the package.

 4. Type `make` to compile the package.

 5. Type `make install` to install the programs and any data files and
    documentation.

 6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
    code directory by typing `make clean`.

By default the files are installed under the /usr/local/ directory (or
similar, depending of the OS you use); however, since Step 5 requires
root privileges, another directory can be specified during Step 3 by
typing:

     $ configure --prefix=<absolute-installation-path>

For example, if "user1" wants to install the Thot package in the
directory /home/user1/thot, the sequence of commands to execute should be
the following:

     $ ./reconf
     $ configure --prefix=/home/user1/thot
     $ make
     $ make install

The installation directory can be the same directory where the Thot
package was decompressed.

See "INSTALL" file for more information.

IMPORTANT NOTE: if Thot is being installed in a PBS cluster (a cluster
providing `qsub` and other related tools), it is important that the
`configure` script is executed in the main cluster node, so as to
properly detect the cluster configuration (do not execute it in an
interactive session).

#### Alternative Installation Options
The Thot configure script can be used to modify the toolkit
behavior. Here is a list of current installation options:

- **--enable-ibm2-alig**: Thot currently uses HMM-based alignment models
to obtain the word alignment matrices required for phrase model
estimation. One alternative installation option allows to replace
HMM-based alignment models by IBM 2 alignment models. IBM 2 alignment
models can be estimated very efficiently without significantly affecting
translation quality.

- **--with-casmacat**: this options enables the configuration
required for the CasMaCat Workbench, see more information below.

#### Installation Including the CasMaCat Workbench
Thot can be combined with the CasMacat Workbench which has been developed
in the project of the same name. [See this webpage] [4] to get the specific
installation instructions.

Relation with Existing Software
-------------------------------
Due to the strong focus of Thot on online and incremental learning, it
includes its own programs to carry out language and translation model
estimation. Specifically, Thot includes tools to work with n-gram
language models based on incrementally updateable sufficient
statistics. On the other hand, Thot also includes a set of tools and a
whole software library to estimate IBM 1, IBM 2 and HMM-based word
alignment models. The estimation process can be carried out using batch
and incremental EM algorithms. This functionality is not based on the
standard GIZA++ software for word alignment model generation.

Additionally, Thot does not use any code from other existing translation
tools. In this regard, Thot tries to offer its own view of the process
of statistical machine translation, with a strong focus on online
learning and also incorporating interactive machine translation
functionality. Another interesting feature of the toolkit is its stable
and robust translation server.

Current Status
--------------
The Thot toolkit is under development. Original public versions of Thot
date back to 2005 [Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2005] and were hosted in
SourceForge. These original versions were strongly focused on the
estimation of phrase-based models. By contrast, current version offers
several new features that had not been previously incorporated.

A set of specific tools to ease the process of making SMT experiments
has been created.  Basic usage instructions have been recently added to
the Thot manual.

On the other hand, there are some toolkit extensions that will be
incorporated in the next months:

- Improved management of concurrency in the Thot translation server
  (concurrent translation processes are currently handled with mutual
  exclusion).

- Virtualized language models (i.e. accessing language model parameters
  from disk).

- Interpolation of language and translation models.

Finally, here is a list of known issues with the Thot toolkit that are
currently being addressed:

- Phrase model training is based on HMM-based word alignment models
  estimated by means of incremental EM. The current implementation is
  slow and currently constitutes a bottleneck when training phrase
  models from large corpora. One already implemented solution is to
  carry out the estimation in multiple processors. Another solution is
  to replace HMM-based models by IBM 2 Models, which can be estimated
  very efficiently. However, we are also investigating alternative
  optimization techniques to efficiently execute the estimation process
  of HMM-based models in a single processor.

- Log-linear model weight adjustment is carried out by means of the
  downhill simplex algorithm, which is very slow. Downhill simplex will
  be replaced by a more efficient technique.

- Non-monotonic translation is not yet sufficiently tested, specially
  with complex corpora such as Europarl.


Support
-------
Project documentation is being developed. Such documentation include:

- These instructions.
- The [Thot manual] [8] ("thot_manual.pdf" under the "doc" directory).

If you need additional help, you can:

- use the [github issue tracker] [9].
- [send an e-mail to the author] [10].
- join the [CasMaCat support group] [11].

Additional information about the theoretical foundations of Thot can be
found in [Ortiz-Martínez, 2011]. One interesting feature of Thot,
incremental (or online) estimation of statistical models, is also
described in [Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2010]. Finally, phrase-level
alignment generation functionality implemented in Thot was proposed in
[Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2008].
